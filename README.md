SmartJets
========

A 2D Projectile game where opponents mimick user strategies with increasing skill via machine learning

## Description

The project is in its beginning stages.  Several jets occupy a circular arena.  The jets can move through
the arena and fire projectiles in any direction at a regular interval.  The user controls one jet and attempts
to hit enemy jets with its projectiles while dodging their projectiles. More importantly, with each consecutive
round of playing, the enemy jets observe and attempt to reproduce the strategy of the user's jet via machine learning.
With each new round, the enemy jets have access to more data and consequently become more skilled.
